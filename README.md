# Code Refactor

## Description

In this challenge, the goal was to refactor pre-written code by consolidating both CSS and HTML code while following a semantic structure. The initial code was messy and lacked clear organization, making it difficult to read and modify. To solve this problem, the code was restructured using semantic HTML tags such as headers, sections, and footers, which greatly improved its readability and organization. Additionally, the CSS code was consolidated by removing duplicate styles, grouping related styles, and using shorthand properties where appropriate. By the end of the assignment, the code was much more organized, easier to understand, and more efficient, making it easier to read, maintain and modify in the future.
